# MultithreadedShortcuts

Assignment: Given a 2d array where arr[i][j] represents the cost to travel from node i to node j, find the shortest possible distance from each node to every other node.
Use multithreading and memory optimization to boost the runtime of your code vs the baseline(single thread, no memory optimizations)

Files Given: ShortcutTester, run-test.sh, SquareMatrix

Written Code: ShortcutThread, SquareMatrix.getShortcutMatrixOptimized()

How to Test: Run ShortcutTester. It will test matrices of different sizes and compare the speedup in runtime to the baseline implementation.
